# Progcode Scraper

Collection of scrapers meant to consolidate
* https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/prog-channels
* https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/prog-members

This is a sinatra app that can easily be extended with more scrapers and more functionality in the future.

The word "scraper" doesn't appear anywhere that isn't plain text. So feel free to change the name as the app itself changes.

Created using this helpful guide: https://flatironschool.com/blog/how-to-build-a-sinatra-web-app-in-10-steps/

To run app:
`$ shotgun`
